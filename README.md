# 🚧 PRODiGY_DS_03 - NYC Traffic Accident Analysis

This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. The goal is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:

- 📍 Road conditions
- ⛅ Weather or environmental effects
- 🕒 Time of day
- ⚠️ Accident hotspots
- 🚗 Contributing factors

We use interactive visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots) to highlight insights and patterns in NYC collision data.

## 📁 Dataset

Due to GitHub's file size limits, only a **sample** of the full dataset (2000 entries) is included in this repository.

📄 **Sample Dataset :
[`sample_motor_vehicle_collisions.csv`](sample_motor_vehicle_collisions.csv)

📦 **Original Full Dataset** (Too large for GitHub, hosted externally):
[🔗 Google Drive Link (400MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ilV7JvDmOi2zhdFwlqsxjuxA5FpmXMFx/view?usp=sharing)

> The original dataset contains over 1 million crash records from NYC, detailing time, location, injuries, and contributing factors.
